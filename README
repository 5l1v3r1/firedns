libfiredns is a library for handling asynchronous DNS
requests.  It provides a very simple interface for sending
requests and parsing reponses, as well as low-timeout
blocking functions.  libfiredns functions have much lower
timeouts than the stock functions and tend to be faster
because they send requests to all configured system
nameservers at the same time.

this version here differs from the original in several ways:
1) doesn't depend on firestring and firemake
2) no global state
3) factored and optimized for small static linkage
4) can be combined with libulz for even smaller static linkage (optional)
5) no dynamic allocation to avoid linking in malloc implementations
   (the code in firedns_add_servers_from_resolve_conf(), unless USE_LIBULZ
    is defined, uses FILE* based stdio functions though which cannot be 
    implemented without malloc().
    if you want to avoid the dependency, you can add your own servers
    instead of parsing resolv.conf, for example 8.8.8.8)

when to use it ?
- if you feel your libc's DNS implementation is too slow for you,
- if you feel your libc's DNS implementation pulls in too much code 
  into static binaries,
- if you need additional functionality such as MX records,
...
